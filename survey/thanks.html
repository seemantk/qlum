						<h3 class="text-center">Why we made this proof of concept.</h3>
						<p>We created this concept at a recent Startup Weekend hackathon for Education.  The focus was on delivering value and resource for the newly adopted Common Core Curriculum in the US school system.  The original concept was a mobile app to deliver practice test questions to students.</p>
						<p>Our focus was on accessibility -- students should be able to excel in school, regardless of their financial circumstances.  In the original cncept, parents would subscribe to and purchase test questions for their children.  Each purchase would also send a practice test to a financially limited student (either at the same school, or in a different school district entirely). We dubbed this concept: <strong>Get, Give, Grow</strong></p> -- inspired by the <a href="http://olpc.org" target="_blank">One Laptop per Child</a> (who came up with the <em>Get one, give one</em> concept).
						<p>Subsequently, we uncovered the real need: the Common Core Curriculum is so new, that education publishers were having trouble even putting out one test book per year.  At the time, states like New York and Louisiana were rejecting 100's of publisher-submitted textbooks per year.  Clearly, the real challenge was in understanding the needs of Common Core.</p>
						<p>We took the grassroots approach: we conceptualized a teacher-driven data bank of test questions -- based on their real world experiences.  We wanted a way for teachers to try questions out and exchange ideas with other teachers. In this model, teachers take a collaborative approach in test design -- instead of spending up to 15-20 hours a week on test design, we envisioned that test questions can be put into a pool, with crowd-curation (like Wikipedia), built around the tenets of "give a test, get a test".</p>
